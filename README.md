# gotorrent

A basic BitTorrent client in Go, built as an exercise in improving my
understanding of networking while at the [Recurse
Center](http://recurse.com).

I wrote about it [here](http://recurse.henrystanley.com).

## Usage

Really, don't.

But if you're sure you want to:

```shell
$ go get github.com/henryaj/gotorrent
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/henryaj/gotorrent
$ go build .
$ ./gotorrent <path to .torrent>
```
